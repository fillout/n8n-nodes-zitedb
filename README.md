## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) on the n8n documentation website.

## Usage

Add the trigger in n8n, and when creating a credential, you'll need to get an API key from your [account settings](https://build.fillout.com/home/settings/developer) in Zite. Make sure that the correct base URL is set, as you can have your data hosted in different regions with [Fillout Enterprise](https://www.fillout.com/enterprise).
